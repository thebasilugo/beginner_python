# python_starter_projects
My 'newbie' programs created with python. Let's see the progress!

1. Grade_point_Calculator (in progress): This is basically as the title presents itself. 
A calculator for college and university students to know what their grade points are and how to easily calculate it, 
if trying to get a prospective estimation.

2. Need_A_Gulp (in progress): This is a restaurant-type program, made to try to simulate workings of a real restaurant.
It isn't a restaurant per-say but more of a beverage (or refreshment) type program. 
It should have workings of customers and staff based on real life possibilities. 

Programming, for me, is all about creativity and the workings of the projects above aren't all figured out yet,
but I just want to do things a little different. A little better.
